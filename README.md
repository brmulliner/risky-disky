For any system of free point charges, the charges will move to reduce the total electrostatic energy of the
system as a whole. These configurations can be found through the execution of the simulated annealing method.
By fine tuning of the algorithm, the arrangements which result in the lowest total energy can be modelled
for different numbers of charges can be found. A disk with n charges will be taken, and the arrangements
resulting in the global minimum energies will be found for 2 ≤ n ≤ 33
